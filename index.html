            <h3>Decimal to Binary Conversion</h3>
            <p>
                Converting a decimal number to binary involves repeatedly dividing the decimal number by 2 and
                recording the remainders. The binary representation is obtained by reading the remainders in
                reverse order.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to convert the decimal number 25 to binary: 25 รท 2 = 12 remainder 1, 12 รท 2 = 6
                remainder 0, 6 รท 2 = 3 remainder 0, 3 รท 2 = 1 remainder 1. Reading the remainders in reverse gives
                the binary representation 11001.
            </p>

            <h3>Binary to Decimal Conversion</h3>
            <p>
                Converting a binary number to decimal involves multiplying each binary digit by the corresponding
                power of 2 and then summing the results. The rightmost bit represents 2^0, the next bit represents
                2^1, and so on.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to convert the binary number 1101 to decimal: (1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 *
                2^0) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13.
            </p>

            <h3>Addition of Decimal Numbers</h3>
            <p>
                In decimal addition, numbers are added column-wise, starting from the rightmost column. If the sum
                in a column exceeds 9, a carry is generated to the next column on the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to add 356 and 278:
                <pre>
                   &emsp;&emsp;  356
                   +&emsp;  278
                   __________
                   &emsp;&emsp;  634
                </pre>
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3>Addition of Binary Numbers</h3>
            <p>
                Binary addition follows the same principles as decimal addition, but with a base of 2. In binary,
                the sum in each column can be 0, 1, or 10 (when the sum is 2). Carryovers occur when the sum is
                10, and they move to the next column on the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to add 1101 and 101:
                <pre>
                   &emsp;&emsp;  1101
                   +&emsp;  101
                   __________
                   &emsp;&emsp; 10010
                </pre>
